CommanderScoreboard
===================

A scoreboard for playing Commander/EDH Games in Magic: the Gathering for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. It tracks Life, Poison, General Recast Cost, and Specific General Damage. It hides the stats you aren't using and displays everything you are on a huge scoreboard. Perfect for projecting on to the wall or on a tabletop touchscreen.

I will probably accept most pull requests. The changes will likely end up in the store version.
